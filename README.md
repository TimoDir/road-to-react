# Road to React

## Robin Wieruch book: Edition 2022

### ROADMAP WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE LEARNING

#### Introduction to React
From project setup to understanding the fundamentals of JavaScript for React, we will cover everything to get you started in this new environment.


#### Basics in React
You will learn everything about React component composition, JSX, state management and props in React to build your first basic React application.


#### Getting real with an API
Handling real data from an API with React makes things more exciting. You will learn how to fetch data and how to display and interact with this data in your React application.


#### Code Organization and Testing
Besides you will get to know how to test your React components and how to organize them in your project.


#### Advanced React Components
Advanced concepts such as higher-order components and render prop components will be covered as well for giving you all the tools to create powerful abstractions.


#### Advanced State Management
Get to know all the pitfalls when it comes to state management in React. Learn how to lift state up and down and how to use the state management API of React.

**Become an Expert in React**







This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
